                this silent night has come to you creeping on  thousands fingers<br>
                its touches that tickles your  body<br>
                will become the numbness of your mornings<br>
                lay there<br>
                lay creature<br>
                filled of blood and memories<br>
                for it's time to be buried under the wight<br>
                of life and air<br>
                lay there<br>
                tiredness is the blood in your veins<br>
                bitter is the taste of despair<br>
                shallow are the ghosts of love<br>
                thinning is the skin you wear<br>
                you saw this world whimpering like a giant...<br>
